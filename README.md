# todojs

todojs is a simple todo app written in vanilla js as a showcase how to
drive your development using TDD practices in Javascript.

## Libraries used

NONE, zip, nada. I am trying to show that working with vanilla javascript
can work just fine.

For testing I am using
[Jasmine 2.2](http://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction.html)


## Other

If requested I might add a version (on a different branch) that shows how
to do the same thing with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (but that might never
happen).
